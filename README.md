# Prework-study-guide
## Description
- My aim is to learn and become a full-stack web developer and get into the field and start working as a developer after learning the required skills.
- I built this project because it taught me the basic knowledge I required to fulfill my goals.
- It helped me in learning some of the concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git etc; that I'll be needing throughout my career as a web develoer. 
- I learned about HTML, which is a structural language used to outline the layout of a webpage. I learned about CSS which is a styling language. JavaScript provides logic to a webpage. Moreover, Git is a very powerful tool when it comes to backing up code on a local machine as well on a remote platform.
